PC configurations

## Composition of desktop PC
A desktop PC is composed of:<br>
- Motherboard.
- CPU.
- RAM.
- Power supply.
- Graphics card (not necessary if integrated graphics exists).
- Storage.
- Chassis (not necessary if you have a reliable container, such as shoe box, to hold other components).
- Monitor (not necessary if you use remote methods to config the PC).

## Notes and mistakes that are easy to made
- Pay attention to compatible sockets of selected CPU and motherboard, they should be the same or you may cause damage to CPU pins when installing it.
- The total power of the PC is suggested to be about half of the nominal power of the power supply (PSU can reach its highest efficiency).
